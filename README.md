## About

The project appears to be a web-based application that allows users to search for countries and view information about them. The application has two main features - the ability to switch between a dark and light theme, and the ability to view the closest countries to a selected country.

The closest countries feature allows users to view a list of countries that are geographically close to the selected country. This feature is particularly useful for users who are interested in exploring neighboring countries or who are planning to travel to a particular region.
